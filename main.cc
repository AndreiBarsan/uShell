/* Ideas and TODOS
 * ---------------
 *  - everything should have a proper interface and a dedicated implementation
 *  - make sure that code handling shell debug traps, pipes, variable handling etc.
 *  is as clean as possible
 *  - yacc should work to generate the grammar like in the regular Bash
 *  - always bear in mind that plugins will have to be able to change anything
 *  - consider blogging about progress
 *  - document self about all variants of redirection in Bash and ensure that they
 *    are all supported
 *  - possible milestones:
 *    - manual (limited) redirection support (i.e. look for >foo >>foo tokens)
 *    - simple job control
 *      - async tasks (&)
 *      - jobs
 *      - bg
 *      - fg
 *      - wait
 *      - disown
 *      - suspend
 *      - kill
 *      - killall
 *      - etc. (http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/x9644.html)
 *    - pipelines:
 *      - as above (`foo & bar`)
 *      - `foo; bar` (no pipes established)
 *      - `foo | bar`
 *      - mixed (`foo; bar | baz`)
 *    - figure out streamlined way to perform e2e testing
