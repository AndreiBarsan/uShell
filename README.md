µShell is meant to be a simple, lightweight, clean, expandable, POSIX-compliant UNIX Shell implementation.

Setup
-----

`make` should *just work*.  There's no `make install` support yet since
the project is still very early in its infancy.

Requires a GCC version that supports C++11 (gcc 4.9+) and libreadline (`sudo apt-get install libreadline6 libreadline6-dev`).
